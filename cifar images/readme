3. Research Questions
a) Does more layersâ€™ system provide a better result?
The experiments I designed to explore this question are training some networks with
different number of layers and see the difference of the results.

b) How does different hidden units affect the result?
The experiments I designed to explore this question are training some networks with different number of hidden units and see how results varies.

c) Which is the most suitable activation function for Cifar dataset?
The experiments I designed to explore this question are training some networks with different nonlinearities, which with the best number of layers and hidden units I tried from the experiments before, to in figure out the best nonlinearity of the network.

d) Which optimizer performs the best for the model?
The experiments I designed to explore this question are training some networks with different optimizers, which with the best number of hidden units, layers and nonlinearity.

e) Will batch normalization help in this model?
The experiment I designed to explore this question is training a network with the best elements I found from previous experiments, and applying batch normalization to this model to see if batch normalization would help to perform better.

f) Will dropout work in this model to reduce the overfitting?
The experiment I designed to explore this question is training a network with the best elements I found form previous experiments, and applying dropout to the model to see how it performs.

g) How does the optimal model that found in Cifar-10 perform in Cifar-100?
Since two datasets are pretty similar, there is no need to test all the processes on the Cifar-100 dataset again. Thus, I will only use the best model I found in Cifar-10 and train it on Cifar-100 dataset.
